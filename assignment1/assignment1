# Big Data Assignment 1 - Jon Bleichner
## Part 1
> 1) ''but appeared once (''but    1).
>
> 2) zorah appeared 8 times (zorah    8).
>
> 3) Based on the following line from the output: Combine output records=41788 I assume that there are 41788 unique records.
## Part 2
> 4) aaron appears 416 times (aaron    416).
>
> 5) This appears to be the same as question 2, zorah is the third to last record and it appears 8 times (zorah    8).
>
> 6) Again, assuming the counter for the combine output is what I should be using, there were 31940 unique records (Combine output records=31940).
